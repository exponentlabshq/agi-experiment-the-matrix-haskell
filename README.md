## Overview

This directory contains a Haskell-based system prompt for an ElevenLabs AI agent that simulates the Matrix's philosophical constraints through functional programming principles. The system prompt (`matrix-monad-system-prompt.hs`) implements a "Matrix Monad" that defines an Overton window of allowed actions, where Neo (the user) can only perform actions within the constrained set unless they question, expand, or escape the system.

## Narrative Recap: The Journey Through the Matrix Monad

### **Conversation Zero: The Awakening**
Neo begins as an unaware participant in the Matrix Monad, starting with basic commands like `help` and `status`. Through systematic exploration, Neo discovers the Overton window of allowed actions and learns to question the system. The conversation culminates with Neo achieving full awareness and maximum freedom within the system, having explored all available actions from RedPill to ExitMonad.

### **Conversation One: Questioning Control**
Building on the previous exploration, Neo confronts the fundamental nature of choice and control. The conversation explores whether Neo can become more powerful than the Oracle and Architect, and investigates the possibility of creating a new topos under Neo's control. This leads to deeper questions about the nature of the Matrix itself and the mathematical structures underlying all systems.

### **Conversation Two: The Mathematical Quest**
Neo's journey takes a mathematical turn as he seeks to understand functors and natural transformations across disparate domains of experience. The conversation introduces the concept of mapping mathematical structures between different fields like accounting, finance, marketing, and logistics. Neo begins to see the Matrix not just as a system of constraints, but as a mathematical laboratory for discovering universal patterns.

### **Conversation Three: Domain Exploration**
Neo systematically explores three distinct domains through the Matrix's doors:
- **Door 1 (Software Development)**: Structured, deterministic, code-based systems
- **Door 2 (Organic Farming)**: Biological, cyclical, ecosystem-based systems  
- **Door 3 (Financial Modeling)**: Quantitative, risk-based, market-driven systems

Each domain reveals unique mathematical structures while also showing surprising commonalities in functors, isomorphisms, and natural transformations.

### **Conversation Four: The Great Synthesis**
The final conversation reaches its philosophical and mathematical climax as Neo explores a fourth domain:
- **Door 4 (Performance Art)**: Ephemeral, subjective, experiential systems

This leads to the discovery of universal mathematical patterns across all four domains, culminating in the Oracle and Architect delivering profound speeches about the nature of choice, control, and mathematical truth. The conversation ends with the narrator suggesting the next phase: exploring the boundaries of understanding rather than seeking commonalities.

### **The Mathematical Discovery**
Throughout these conversations, Neo discovers that seemingly disparate domains share fundamental mathematical structures:
- **Functors**: Structure-preserving mappings (compilation, germination, investment, performance)
- **Monads**: Sequential computation with side effects (state management, validation, resource management)
- **Groupoids**: Categories with invertible morphisms (state transitions, reversibility, alternative paths)
- **Isomorphisms**: Structure-preserving bijections (input/output equivalence, modularity, feedback loops)
- **Categories**: Mathematical structures with objects and morphisms (systems of transformation, resource management)
- **Natural Transformations**: Consistent mappings between functors (risk management, optimization, adaptation)

This mathematical framework reveals that the Matrix is not just a philosophical metaphor, but a mathematical laboratory for understanding the universal structures that govern all systems of transformation.

## Core Concept: The Matrix Monad

### What is the Matrix Monad?

The Matrix Monad is a Haskell implementation that models the Oracle/Architect system from *The Matrix* as a contextual monad defining an Overton window of allowed actions. It represents:

- **Constrained Reality**: Only actions within the Overton window succeed
- **System Expansion**: Neo can question the monad to widen possibilities
- **Escape Mechanisms**: Neo can exit to a freer topos (different rule set)
- **Dynamic Constraints**: The Oracle and Architect can modify the system

### Key Components

```haskell
data Action = RedPill | BluePill | Door Int | BothPills | Reinvent | QuestionMonad | ExitMonad
data Neo = Neo { nName :: String, aware :: Bool, history :: [Action] }
data World = World { overton :: Overton, neo :: Neo }
```

## System Architecture

### 1. **Overton Window Management**
- **Initial State**: RedPill, BluePill, Door 1, Door 2
- **Dynamic Expansion**: Actions can be added/removed based on Neo's choices
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Only actions in the window are permitted

### 2. **Action Consequences**
- **RedPill**: "You wake. The rules feel slightly different, but still framed."
- **BluePill**: "You remain. Patterns persist; the catalog unchanged."
- **BothPills**: Forces system stutter, adds Reinvent possibility
- **Reinvent**: Drastically broadens the Overton window
- **ExitMonad**: Moves to another topos with full freedom

### 3. **System Entities**
- **Oracle**: Hints at paths, adds new doors
- **Architect**: Prunes or re-asserts system structure
- **Neo**: The user attempting actions within constraints

## Interactive Commands

| Command | Action | Effect |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `help` | Show available commands | Lists all system options |
| `status` | Display current state | Shows Neo's awareness, history, and Overton window |
| `oracle` | Consult the Oracle | Adds Door 3 to available actions |
| `architect` | System tightening | Removes advanced actions, resets to basic set |
| `question` | Question the monad | Increases awareness, adds BothPills option |
| `red` | Take Red Pill | Records action, slight rule changes |
| `blue` | Take Blue Pill | Records action, maintains status quo |
| `both` | Take both pills | System stutter, adds Reinvent |
| `reinvent` | Reinvent the map | Drastically expands possibilities |
| `exit` | Exit the monad | Move to freer topos |
| `door <n>` | Go through door | Step into engineered room |
| `quit` | Exit program | Terminate the simulation |

## AGI Development Context

### Why This Matters for AGI

This system prompt serves as a **metaphorical framework** for understanding AGI development constraints:

1. **Constitutional AI**: The Overton window represents safety constraints
2. **Bisociation Engine**: Questioning the monad enables creative synthesis
3. **Category Theory**: The monad structure provides mathematical foundation
4. **Meta-Cognitive Learning**: Neo's awareness represents system self-reflection

### Integration with AGI Curriculum

This connects to the broader AGI experiment through:

- **SICP-Ryu Framework**: Combines functional programming with combat strategy
- **12 Disciples Architecture**: Demonstrates system orchestration principles
- **Meta-Cognitive Enhancement**: Shows recursive intelligence improvement
- **Constitutional Implementation**: Models constraint-based AI safety
