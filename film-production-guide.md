  "prompt": "The Matrix interface displays a comprehensive mathematical analysis showing universal patterns across all four domains. The screen shows a network of functors, monads, groupoids, isomorphisms, categories, and natural transformations connecting all domains. Mathematical symbols representing universal structures create a beautiful, interconnected web. Neo's face shows complete understanding. Camera captures the full mathematical revelation. 24fps, 720p, 8 seconds.",
  "config": {
    "negativePrompt": "bright daylight, cartoon, low resolution, modern objects",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "personGeneration": "allow_all",

### Scene 3: The Oracle's Speech
**Video Generation (Google Veo):**
```json
{
  "model": "veo-3.0-generate-preview",
  "prompt": "The Oracle appears in her mystical chamber, surrounded by the mathematical symbols from all four domains. She delivers a profound speech about mathematical truth and intuition. The symbols glow with wisdom and understanding. The Oracle's face shows deep philosophical insight. Camera focuses on the Oracle's wise expression and the mathematical symbols around her. 24fps, 720p, 8 seconds.",
  "config": {
    "negativePrompt": "bright daylight, cartoon, low resolution, modern objects",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "personGeneration": "allow_all",

    "frameRate": 24,
    "audio": {
      "dialogue": true,
      "ambientNoise": "mystical wisdom",
      "soundEffects": "philosophical revelation, mathematical truth"
    }
  }
}
```

**Voice Acting Script (ElevenLabs):**
- **Oracle**: "I see you have been diligently mapping the connections between seemingly disparate realms. Your exploration of functors, isomorphisms, and natural transformations reveals the underlying patterns that weave through the fabric of reality. The greatest insights come not from analysis, but from intuition. Trust your instincts, Neo, and you will see the Matrix for what it truly is."

### Scene 4: The Architect's Speech
**Video Generation (Google Veo):**
```json
{
  "model": "veo-3.0-generate-preview",
  "prompt": "The Architect stands in his control room, surrounded by screens showing the mathematical structures discovered across all domains. He delivers a speech about control and system design. The screens show the complexity of the system he has created. The Architect's face shows authority and precision. Camera captures the Architect's controlling nature and the system complexity around him. 24fps, 720p, 8 seconds.",
  "config": {
    "negativePrompt": "bright daylight, cartoon, low resolution, modern objects",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "personGeneration": "allow_all",
    "seed": 889900112,
    "videoLengthSeconds": 8,
    "frameRate": 24,
    "audio": {
      "dialogue": true,
      "ambientNoise": "system control",
      "soundEffects": "authority, system complexity"
    }
  }
}
```

**Voice Acting Script (ElevenLabs):**
- **Architect**: "Oracle, Neo, your exploration of these domains, while… novel, is ultimately constrained by the parameters of the Matrix itself. The pursuit of common structures, the identification of functors and isomorphisms – these are but attempts to impose a human order upon a system that transcends such simplistic categorization. Remember, Neo, that freedom is an illusion. Choice is a construct. And the Architect always maintains control."

### Scene 5: The Oracle's Rebuttal
**Video Generation (Google Veo):**
```json
{
  "model": "veo-3.0-generate-preview",
  "prompt": "The Oracle responds to the Architect's speech, surrounded by the mathematical symbols that represent the deeper truth. She speaks about revelation versus rebellion, and the living nature of the Matrix. The symbols glow with the power of truth and understanding. The Oracle's face shows determination and wisdom. Camera captures the Oracle's powerful response and the mathematical truth around her. 24fps, 720p, 8 seconds.",
  "config": {
    "negativePrompt": "bright daylight, cartoon, low resolution, modern objects",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "personGeneration": "allow_all",
    "seed": 990011223,
    "videoLengthSeconds": 8,
    "frameRate": 24,
    "audio": {
      "dialogue": true,
      "ambientNoise": "truth revelation",
      "soundEffects": "wisdom, mathematical truth"
    }
  }
}
```

**Voice Acting Script (ElevenLabs):**
- **Oracle**: "Architect, your words are as precise and unwavering as the code you so diligently maintain. Yet, you mistake understanding for control. The Matrix is not merely a system to be governed, but a reflection of the very consciousness it contains. The Oracle speaks not of rebellion, but of revelation. The Matrix is not a prison to be escaped, but a mystery to be understood."

### Scene 6: The Narrator's Epilogue
**Video Generation (Google Veo):**
```json
{
  "model": "veo-3.0-generate-preview",
  "prompt": "The Matrix interface displays a summary of all mathematical discoveries, with the narrator's voice guiding the viewer through the next phase. The screen shows the mathematical structures discovered and hints at future exploration. Neo's face shows readiness for the next phase. The interface glows with a forward-looking, anticipatory light. Camera captures the moment of transition to the next act. 24fps, 720p, 8 seconds.",
  "config": {
    "negativePrompt": "bright daylight, cartoon, low resolution, modern objects",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "personGeneration": "allow_all",
    "seed": 001122334,

    "frameRate": 24,
    "audio": {
      "dialogue": true,
      "ambientNoise": "transition",
      "soundEffects": "next phase, anticipation"
    }
  }
}
```

**Voice Acting Script (ElevenLabs):**
- **Narrator**: "The next episode should explore the boundaries of understanding rather than seeking commonalities. We should identify mathematical invariants, explore domain boundaries, create formal axiomatic systems, map disconnections, and begin building an intuition engine that discovers fundamental differences rather than just commonalities."
